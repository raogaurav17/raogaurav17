<p style="color:#94A1B2; font-style:italic;">I like building things that learn, adapt, and scale.</p> Some of them classify medical images, some generate new ones, some crunch data across clusters, and some just quietly do their job in the background. I enjoy the whole pipeline — from experimenting with models to wiring them into systems that can actually be used.

- Training deep learning models and pushing them into real applications.
- Building lightweight, fast APIs for ML inference.
- Playing with transformers, diffusion ideas, and generative tricks.
- Making ML workflows reproducible with tools like DVC and MLflow.
- Running distributed jobs just to see how far I can scale something.

### Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
A vision model built with Swin Transformer and trained on a large retinal dataset. The fun part wasn’t just the model — it was wiring everything into a full-stack app: a fast Flask inference server paired with a clean React interface.

### Financial Data AI Agent
An LLM-driven system for fetching and analyzing financial data through custom tools. FastAPI handles the backend, and LangGraph brings structure to the agent flow.

### RetainStack
An experiment in turning ML workflows into something closer to production engineering. Reproducible training, automated checks, versioned data, and deployment pipelines that don’t fall apart.

### WGAN-GP
A generative model trained for 256×256 image synthesis. This project taught me more about debugging model instability than about generating anime faces — which is probably the real lesson.

### Web Projects that balance out the ML
I build web interfaces mostly to give my ML systems a real surface that people can interact with, but a few standalone projects have been fun on their own:

- **React + Zustand apps** for interactive stateful UIs — clean, minimal, and easy to scale.
- **Next.js dashboards** that connect directly to APIs or model inference endpoints for exploring predictions, embeddings, or dataset slices.
- **TailwindCSS interfaces** for tools like image annotators, metric explorers, and lightweight admin panels.
- **Utility tools** like form builders, small CLIs exposed through simple web UIs, and quick prototypes for both ML and non‑ML workflows.

Some of these started as helpers for ML experiments; others turned into full projects because they were too useful to ignore.

I like making systems people can actually touch, not just notebooks that run once.

I’ve solved a decent number of DSA problems, usually late at night when I should be doing something else. I also experiment a lot with distributed systems — Spark clusters, custom Docker networks, that kind of playground.
