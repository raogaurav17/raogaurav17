# Hi, I'm Gaurav

I like building things that learn, adapt, and scale. Some of them classify medical images, some generate new ones, some crunch data across clusters, and some just quietly do their job in the background. I enjoy the whole pipeline — from experimenting with models to wiring them into systems that can actually be used.

## What I’m into right now
- Training deep learning models and pushing them into real applications.
- Building lightweight, fast APIs for ML inference.
- Playing with transformers, diffusion ideas, and generative tricks.
- Making ML workflows reproducible with tools like DVC and MLflow.
- Running distributed jobs just to see how far I can scale something.

These change depending on the project, but these are the ones I reach for most often.

## Things I’ve been building lately

### Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
A vision model built with Swin Transformer and trained on a large retinal dataset. The fun part wasn’t just the model — it was wiring everything into a full-stack app: a fast Flask inference server paired with a clean React interface.

### Financial Data AI Agent
An LLM-driven system for fetching and analyzing financial data through custom tools. FastAPI handles the backend, and LangGraph brings structure to the agent flow.

### RetainStack
An experiment in turning ML workflows into something closer to production engineering. Reproducible training, automated checks, versioned data, and deployment pipelines that don’t fall apart.

### WGAN-GP
A generative model trained for 256×256 image synthesis. This project taught me more about debugging model instability than about generating anime faces — which is probably the real lesson.

### Web Projects that balance out the ML
I build web interfaces mostly to give my ML systems a real surface that people can interact with, but a few standalone projects have been fun on their own:

- **React + Zustand apps** for interactive stateful UIs — clean, minimal, and easy to scale.
- **Next.js dashboards** that connect directly to APIs or model inference endpoints for exploring predictions, embeddings, or dataset slices.
- **TailwindCSS interfaces** for tools like image annotators, metric explorers, and lightweight admin panels.
- **Utility tools** like form builders, small CLIs exposed through simple web UIs, and quick prototypes for both ML and non‑ML workflows.

Some of these started as helpers for ML experiments; others turned into full projects because they were too useful to ignore.

I like making systems people can actually touch, not just notebooks that run once.

## Other stuff
I’ve solved a decent number of DSA problems, usually late at night when I should be doing something else. I also experiment a lot with distributed systems — Spark clusters, custom Docker networks, that kind of playground.
